## Overview of the analysis:
The purpose of this analysis is to help W. Avy who is planning to build a shop at Oahu we need to see the weather patterns of that location Oahu .
One way to provide this insight is with a visualization—we'll plot the results of our precipitation analysis using Matplotlib.
Using statistical analysis—such as the mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum will help to determine if investing in the shop at Oahu will be a good idea or not.
It's clear from your analysis that Oahu is a great location for the new surf shop.
There are 9 stations from which precipitation data is being collected,we need to know how active the stations are as well
  
SQLite to store the weather data.SQLite provides a quick way to setup a database engine without requiring a server.In order to connect to the SQLite database, we'll use SQLAlchemy.SQLAlchemy will help us easily connect to our database where we'll store the weather data.
W. Avy is concerned about the amount of precipitation on Oahu. There needs to be enough rain to keep everything green, but not so much that you lose out on that ideal surfing and ice cream weather
